# E-commerce-website
This E-commerce website project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It provides an easy-to-use online shopping experience with features like user sign-up and login, product listings, and a shopping cart. An admin panel allows for managing product listings. The backend uses Node.js and Express.js to handle data and requests, while MongoDB stores all the data. The frontend, made with React, gives users a smooth and responsive interface. This project showcases how to create a complete e-commerce platform, though currently it does not include payment features .
